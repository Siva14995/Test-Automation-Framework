
**Test Automation Framework**

This is a Java-based Test Automation Framework designed for UI testing. 
The framework follows data-driven testing principles and integrates with LambdaTest for cloud execution. 
It supports headless execution for faster test runs and generates detailed Extent Reports along with Log4j logs.

## Setup Instructions

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Siva14995/Test-Automation-Framework.git
cd Test-Automation-Framework
```

**Reports & Logs**

**Test Execution Report**
- Generated using Extent Reports.
- Output: automationreport.html in the project root.
- Open the report in a browser for a detailed test summary.
**Logs**
- Logs are generated using Log4j.
- Output: logs/ directory.
- Check log files for debugging test failures.

**Integrated the project Github Actions**:
This automation framework is integrated with github actions.
The tests will be executed at 11:30PM IST every single day.

The reports will be archieved in gh-pages branch

** Running Tests on LambdaTest**

```bash
  mvn test -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdatest=true -DisHeadless=false -X
```

** Running Tests on Chrome browser on Local Machine in Headless Mode**


```bash
  mvn test -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdatest=false -DisHeadless=true -X
```
